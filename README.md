# PandasUsefulCommands

I will use one of the csv files of the Capital Bikeshare trip history data to try some of the most useful Pandas commands.

The Capital Bikeshare trip history data is available on: https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data

AS described in the web, the data includes:

* Duration – Duration of trip
* Start Date – Includes start date and time
* End Date – Includes end date and time
* Start Station – Includes starting station name and number
* End Station – Includes ending station name and number
* Bike Number – Includes ID number of bike used for the trip
* Member Type – Indicates whether user was a "registered" member or a "casual" rider
